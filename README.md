# Awesome MCP Servers ![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)

A comprehensive collection of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

## Model Context Protocol

MCP is like a USB-C port for AI. It’s an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to language models — enabling them to securely connect to tools, databases, APIs, filesystems, and more.

## Coverage

This repo currently includes coverage for 4658 MCP servers as of April 7, 2025.
